# 58 Hiring: Resume Activeness Prediction

The goal is to predicte resume activeness in near future, in online recruitment
scenarioes. The project is my thesis and codes here are the experiments.

According to the scenario characteristics, the features extracted from data 
cover resume user normal information, user activeness history, as well as 
resume-position matching degree information.

Tested predictors include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boost 
Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and several hybrid models. The 
proposed new model RFLRP has good effectiveness in predicting and meanwhile can
control the recall rate compared to precision through a single parameter.
